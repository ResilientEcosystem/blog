Arrayán stands as a revolutionary web application, seamlessly integrated with the Resilient DB blockchain fabric. Designed to empower industries, Arrayán facilitates comprehensive tracking of products, by-products, and their historical journey throughout the supply chain. The platform champions transparency, aiding food organizations in effortlessly visualizing information from farm to retail.

Our mission with Arrayán extends beyond mere tracking; we aim to redefine traceability for sustainability. Notably, the platform introduces a key feature allowing consumers and other industry sectors to claim food by-products - stems, peels, and seeds. This forward-thinking approach not only fosters transparency but also encourages the responsible use of by-products. This reclaimed data on generation times and methods becomes invaluable. It opens doors for scaling the utilization of these by-products, transforming them into raw materials for extracting valuable molecules for cosmetics and generating hydrogen - two prized assets in today's dynamic economy. Arrayán is not just a tool for tracking; it's a catalyst for sustainable innovation and resource optimization.

- We have modified the existing ResilientDB-GraphQL APIs catering to the needs of a blockchain-based food supply chain and added a new API to fetch the products in the forked [repo](https://github.com/Amoolya-Reddy/ResilientDB-GraphQL).


## Problem Identified

Scientific evidence supports the potential of food by-products as valuable sources of molecules for the cosmetic industry. However, their utilization has been limited as the chemical composition and yield variability are influenced by factors such as variety, environmental conditions, and the methods of cultivation and processing. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive traceability for most by-products, hindering the recording of crucial data. This absence of information results in a lack of standardization, contributing to uncertain yields and increased costs associated with the extraction and purification processes. A parallel challenge is observed in the use of by-products for hydrogen production and other upcycling applications.

## Solution

This web application plays a pivotal role in meticulously tracing the generation of by-products at each stage. This granular information is instrumental in standardizing by-products, facilitating their upcycling on a larger scale, and pinpointing key areas where substantial amounts of by-products are produced. Our traceability-for-sustainability model not only offers a blueprint for companies to embrace circular economy models but also ensures compliance with regulations such as the Food Safety Modernization Act.
The primary objective of the Food Safety Modernization Act is to enhance food safety. In the event of a foodborne incident, rapid tracking within 24 hours is mandated. The regulation emphasizes the necessity for companies to share information seamlessly across their supply chain, and blockchain emerges as a powerful tool to streamline this process.
Arrayán stands as more than just a tracing tool; it is a catalyst for the food industry to not only meet regulatory requirements but also to potentially increase profitability from their by-products and reduce its environmental footprint.
**During the development of the application, we established a partnership with the teaching and research winery of UC Davis. To kick-start our journey, we are delivering a Proof of Concept utilizing the data generously provided by our collaborators.**

*Note: Arrayán also aligns with Senate Bill 1883, offering a pathway to compliance with this additional regulation.*

## Architecture

The sequence diagrams of the inventory manager and product tracker below give an overview of the function triggers and the process of upload/claim.

</p>

Upon breaking the overall architecture, the user is authenticated and will be provided with a dashboard, current inventory, and product tracker.
1. Dashboard fetches data from the Google Firestore and displays the real-time data in sync with the ResilientDb.
2. After uploading the inventory from an Excel file or providing the manual input, transactions are constructed to the Schema required for the GraphQL server of ResilientDb, and POST_TRANSACTION mutation is used to save the data to the ResilientDb. Upon a successful response, transaction IDs are stored in the Google Firestore. Only transaction IDs and metadata are saved outside the ResilientDb, ensuring data transparency on the global-scale blockchain fabric — ResilientDb.
3. When a user searches for a product, the relevant transaction IDs are retrieved from Google Firestore, and point queries are made to ResilientDb. The complete food supply chain is displayed, detailing each stage. The system also allows users to claim byproducts generated during the process. Claimed byproducts are recorded as transactions on ResilientDb, with their transaction IDs securely stored in Google Firestore.
