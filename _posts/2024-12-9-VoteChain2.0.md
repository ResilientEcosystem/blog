## Overview

VoteChain 2.0 builds on the foundation of the original ResilientApp VoteChain, utilizing **ResilientDB's scalable blockchain infrastructure** to create a customizable and secure voting platform. The enhanced app includes customizable voting, voting history, and a results page and discussion panel for each poll. **ResVault** now provides blockchain-based authentication and enables authorized voting and discussion access. ResilientDB's blockchain guarantees data integrity, anonymity, and privacy, positioning VoteChain as a scalable solution for institutions seeking transparent yet customizable feedback mechanisms.

## Motivation

While the original ResilientApp VoteChain was designed for government-level elections, we recognized an opportunity to bring the benefits of secure, transparent voting to smaller communities. Research into voting fairness in the gaming community inspired the idea of decentralized, transparent voting to prevent fraud and build trust. To address these issues, we envisioned a solution that seamlessly blends security with user-friendly functionality that encourages collaboration and engagement. Leveraging ResilientDB's robust blockchain capabilities, we developed VoteChain 2.0 â€” a secure, decentralized platform tailored for community use.

## Steps to Run the System

### Requirements

1. **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/) based on your platform.
2. **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is included with Node.js. Verify installation:

    ```bash
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```

### Running VoteChain

1. Clone the VoteChain Git repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ItsBaiShiXi/VoteChain.git
    cd VoteChain
    ```

2. Install required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Once the dependencies are installed successfully:
   - Open a terminal and run the following command to start the backend:

        ```bash
        npm run start-backend
        ```

   - Open another terminal and run the following command to start the frontend:

        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

   - This will launch the application, and you can access it in your web browser.

4. Connect the ResVault Chrome extension. You can now anonymously log in to VoteChain through ResVault.
