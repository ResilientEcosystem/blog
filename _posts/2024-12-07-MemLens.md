# What is MemLens?

MemLens is a comprehensive CPU and memory profiler designed for ResilientDB, offering granular, real-time performance insights through continuous profiling. By integrating advanced profiling tools such as eBPF, Node Exporter, Process Exporter, LevelDB internal statistics, and custom Prometheus hooks, MemLens provides a robust platform for database-specific metrics.

Our platform delivers detailed insights into the inner workings of the database, empowering users to optimize system performance effectively. Key metrics include cache hit ratios, storage and disk performance, CPU usage, call stack visualizations, dependency graphs, and more. The integration of continuous profiling ensures that performance trends and anomalies can be identified over time, enabling proactive optimization and system tuning.

MemLens represents an ambitious and evolving vision to bridge the gap between high-level performance monitoring and low-level system insights. We are proud to share a packaged version that highlights the potential of this innovative tool and are committed to ongoing improvements to push the boundaries of database profiling.

## Architecture

Below is a architecture diagram of MemLens:

    <br>
    <em>Figure 1. Diagram displaying the architecture of MemLens and how profiling metrics are collected.
    </em>
</p>

The diagram can be broken down as follows. A client request for a particular metric is made by the client to the middleware. This layer acts as a data aggregation platform which collects metrics from the ResDB environment. The various data sources include time series data from `node_exporter`, call stack data from [pyroscope](https://pyroscope.io/), storage engine metrics from hooks integrated into ResDB's CPP source code. ResDB Graphql service is also running to interface GET and SET API calls via HTTP requests.

ResView offers both ways to interact with the ResilientDB architecture, as well as ways to visualize what is occurring in ResilientDB. Users are able to interact with ResilientDB through the application using the transaction forms and "make a replica faulty" buttons. Within the transaction forms, users input the data fields for the transaction they wish to send and press either set or get. Once this transaction is confirmed, it is sent via Axios to the sdk, which verifies the transaction and forwards it to the ReslientDB backend, where it is then processed and executed.

## Metrics

### Call Stack Visualization

    <em>Figure 2. Flamegraph showing Call Stack when a transaction is retrieved
    </em>
</p>
Flamegraph showing the call stack when a Get method is called on ResilientDB's key value store. This graph shows the function caller which is invoked by the ResilientDB-GraphQL service and is serviced at the end by the storage engine which is LevelDB. The storage engine calls the in memory LRU cache to check for cache hits and when not found calls its internal functions to retrieve the key value pair.

### CPU Usage

This data is collected from [process-exporter](https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter) which is used to profile individual processes and export metrics through prometheus. We run `process-exporter` as `systemd` process to ensure persistent monitoring.

### Storage Engine Metrics

</p>
Dashboard showing storage engine metrics, like cache hit ratio, approximate database size of leveldb, snapshot of process metrics like RSS, number of block reads and number of block writes. Each metric has a information tooltip which can be used to display more information about the metrics.

### Disk Metrics

</p>
Dashboard showing disk metrics like time spent during IO, disk read and write data, disk IOPS (Input and Output operations per second) and disk average wait time. These metrics are exposed by `node_exporter` and are exporter through prometheus. We run `node_exporter` as `systemd` process to ensure persistent monitoring.

### Dependency Analyzer

</p>
Dependency Graph for ResDB's KV Service obtained by running the command `bazel query --notool_deps --noimplicit_deps "deps(//service/kv:kv_service, $(depth))"`. The value of depth can be selected among 2,3 and 4. This generated a deeper dependency graph with links to libraries and other dependent services.


## Data Collection

MemLens uses a data aggregation layer, a thin HTTP service which sits between the Visualizer and the ResDB environment. As the name suggests this aggregation layer collects data from various profiling tools and exposes a single platform for the frontend to request data. We chose this architecture as it would allows us to scale this system by introducing time series databases in the future to collect data over a period of time and analyze trends and gauge behaviour.

## Data Sources

MemLens leverages a wide range of tools and integrations to provide detailed, real-time performance insights for ResilientDB. By utilizing data from various industry-standard sources, MemLens offers a holistic view of system performance. Below is an overview of the key data sources:

# Usage

## Prerequisites

Before running the MemLens application, you need to start kv service on the ResDB backend and the sdk.

### ResilientDB
Git clone the MemLens backend repository, a fork of ResilientDB and follow the instructions to set it up:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harish876/incubator-resilientdb
```
Setup KV Service:
```bash

./service/tools/kv/server_tools/start_kv_service_monitoring.sh
```

### SDK
Git clone the GraphQL Repository and follow the instructions on the README to set it up:

Install GraphQL:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ResilientApp/ResilientDB-GraphQL

```
Setup SDK:
```bash
bazel build service/http_server:crow_service_main

bazel-bin/service/http_server/crow_service_main service/tools/config/interface/client.config service/http_server/server_config.config
```

### Middleware
Git clone the MemLens Middleware Repository:

Install MemLens Middleware:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harish876/MemLens-middleware
```

Setup MemLens Middleware:
```bash
npm instal

npm run start
```

###  Monitoring tools
Follow this [link](https://github.com/Bismanpal-Singh/MemLens/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) to setup prometheus, grafana and a few other monitoring tools used in this application.

With these 3 services running, the MemLens front end can now send aggregate metrics from the middleware.


## Running the MemLens Application

Clone the repo and open in a new folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bismanpal-Singh/MemLens
npm install
```

Run the below code to start the app and load the script.

```bash
npm run dev
```
## Using the MemLens Application

Once ResView has been started, go to http://localhost:5173

You will see a landing page with a brief description of the project and on scrolling down will see a brief of the PBFT protocol, and a explorer card to access the dashboard.

Once the dashboard page has loaded, it will make an API call to the middleware running on http://localhost:3002 to check if the middleware is active and running. If the middleware is running and all profiling tools are installed then , the dashboard switches to a `Live` mode which fetches live data from the middleare. If no accompanying backend services are running, then the app switches to a `Offline` mode which loads snapshots of data collected by the team. This mode could be used for exploration and familiarising with the interface.

The dashboard has 3 tabs, Memory Tracker, CPU and Bazel Build. The memory tracker loads a playground which is a terminal emulator to `GET` and `SET` values into the KV store. A dashboard card dedicated to storage engine metrics and disk metrics. Each graphical card can be be refreshed which will refresh the data. The CPU tab displays a CPU Line graph which displays a graphical view of CPU usage over a period of time, and a accompanying flamegraph to display the call stack. The line graph can be highlighted into in order to magnify the CPU usage over that specific time window and the flamegraph automatically updates according to the time frame chosen.  The bazel build tab displa a dependency graph showcasing the dependencies for the KV service and a select menu to dynamically change the depth of the graph output and the command run to generate the visualized build data.

# Future Work

1. Package, installation and setup of monitoring tools into a bash script or ansible playbook.
2. Remote setup of MemLens middleware and migrating the current setup to an AWS EC2 instance or Linode.
3. Set up profiling tools on a Raspberry Pi and collect metrics.
4. Development of eBPF profiler from scratch and integrating it into code, instead of using a sandboxed profiling environment.
5. Stabilising metric collection and develop a `remote` mode to push data into InfluxDB to analyze trends.
