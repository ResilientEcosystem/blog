# ResShare
## A ResilientDB App

## Introduction

**ResShare** is a decentralized file-sharing system built on ResilientDB and IPFS,that allows transferring any types of files with no limit on size of the file. Unlike traditional platforms, ResShare eliminates single points of failure by combining ResilientDB's tamper-proof metadata storage with IPFS's distributed file system. The platform enables secure file uploads, retrievals, and deletions while ensuring efficient management of metadata.
## Key Features

### Decentralized File Storage
- Files are distributed across the IPFS Cluster network, removing any single points of failure.
- Redundant storage ensures file availability even during network disruptions.

### Tamper-Proof Metadata
- Metadata such as CIDs and file details are securely stored in ResilientDB.
- Immutability guarantees reliable verification during file retrieval and deletions.

### Data Integrity Verification
- File integrity is validated by comparing the retrieved file's hash with stored metadata.
- Prevents tampering or corruption in storage and retrieval processes.

### Custom IPFS ClusterService Integrations
- Users can setup their own cluster service and use the ResShare application for private networks.

### Interactive Dashboard
- Provides real-time insights into uploaded files and their statuses.

### Intuitive User Interface
- A responsive interface facilitates seamless file uploads, retrievals, and management.
- Real-time feedback enhances usability and transparency.

## System Architecture

ResShare integrates two core technologiesâ€”ResilientDB for metadata management and IPFS Cluster Service for distributed file storage. The following components constitute the system:

#### Setup IPFS Cluster Service(Optional)
Set up your own IPFS Cluster Service by following the steps provided on the 
[IPFS Cluster Service Home Page](https://ipfscluster.io/documentation/deployment/setup/).

After setting up, update the URL in the `config/ipfs.config` file.

> **Note**: Share the IPFS Cluster secret key with other nodes that you want to add to the private network.


#### Building the Project
- For Ubuntu 24:  
```bash
  cd bazel 
  bazel build //... --action_env=CC=/usr/bin/gcc-11 --action_env=CXX=/usr/bin/g++-11 --cxxopt="-std=c++17"
```

- For Ubuntu 22:
```bash
cd bazel  
bazel build //...
```

#### Run the Flask Server
- Start the Flask server:  
```bash
export FLASK_APP=controller.py flask run
```
OR  
```bash
python3 controller.py
```

#### Testing
- **Upload a file**:  
```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/upload -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"file_path": "Specify file path here"}'
```

- **Get all peers**:  
```bash  
  curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/peers
```

- **Get file status**:  
```bash  
  curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/file_status/(file_cid)
```

- **Download a file**: 
```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/download -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"cid": "(file_cid)", "file_path": "Specify file path here""}'
```

- **Get other peer's file structure**:  
```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/peer_files/(peer_id)
```

- **Get all files**:  
```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/all_files

ResShare demonstrates the potential of decentralized technologies to transform file sharing by addressing challenges of security, scalability, and user control. With its robust architecture, intuitive UI, and comprehensive features, ResShare offers a reliable solution for modern file-sharing needs, setting a strong foundation for future advancements in decentralized systems.

## Future Work

While ResShare has successfully demonstrated the potential of decentralized technologies for file sharing, there are several areas where the platform can be enhanced to address emerging challenges and further improve its capabilities:

1. **End-to-End Encryption**:  
   Implementing end-to-end encryption for files and metadata to enhance security and ensure that only authorized users within the network can access the data.

2. **Access Control Mechanisms**:  
   Introducing granular access controls, such as role-based permissions, to allow users to specify who can view, download the files.

3. **Improved Scalability**:  
   Exploring advanced techniques like sharding or dynamic clustering in IPFS to handle larger datasets and increasing numbers of users effectively.

4. **Mobile Application Development**:  
   Building mobile applications for Android and iOS to expand the accessibility of ResShare and cater to a broader user base.

5. **Improve Performnace**:  
   Reduce the time required to fetch files from ResilientDB and apply filters to view a specific peer's files.

By addressing these areas, ResShare can evolve into a more secure, scalable, and user-centric platform, unlocking new opportunities in decentralized file sharing and beyond.
