Managing group expenses and financial transactions is often tedious, error-prone, and vulnerable to privacy breaches with traditional methods. Centralized platforms lack transparency, risk data breaches, and fail to provide secure, real-time updates. This creates a need for a decentralized, transparent, and user-friendly solution to ensure trust, automate calculations, and securely manage group expenses. Coinsensus addresses these challenges with blockchain technology and a seamless interface, redefining expense management.

### What is Coincensus?

Coinsensus, a blockchain-based bill management platform powered by ResilientDB, is designed to create a trustless and transparent system for expense tracking among friends and groups. By leveraging blockchain technology's decentralized and tamper-resistant nature, the project ensures secure and reliable monitoring of debts and lending without relying on a central authority.

Through integrating **ResilientDB¹**, a high-performance blockchain framework that uses Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus Protocol (PBFT)² internally, the system achieves fault tolerance, low latency, and scalability, guaranteeing data integrity even in environments prone to network failures or malicious attacks.

Additionally, Coinsensus also automates balance calculations and updates while maintaining an immutable transaction history, addressing ineﬃciencies in manual record-keeping and vulnerabilities in centralized systems. This product aims to redefine financial technology by oﬀering a resilient, decentralized solution³ that prioritizes data privacy and transparency for the users.

### Why Coinsensus?

* **Strengthens Transaction Management with ResilientDB:** Our integration with ResilientDB significantly enhances Coinsensus’ ability to manage financial transactions with unparalleled trust and transparency. Leveraging ResilientDB’s decentralized framework, the platform ensures fault tolerance and robust data integrity, even during network disruptions and malicious activities. This integration provides users with a secure, resilient, and high-performance system, redefining the reliability of payment management.

* **Streamlined Group Expense Tracking:** The core of our application is a robust system for automatic and transparent expense sharing among group members or individuals. Each transaction is securely recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable and tamper-proof ledger while enabling real-time balance updates. This eliminates the need for manual record-keeping, enhancing eﬃciency, accuracy, and trust within the group and individuals.

* **User-Friendly Interface:** Our frontend application, developed using ReactJS, delivers a seamless and engaging user experience. With an intuitive and user-friendly design, it empowers users to eﬃciently manage their transactions, whether it’s adding expenses, tracking real-time balances, or accessing a detailed transaction history. The application ensures smooth navigation and functionality, making group expense management eﬀortless and accessible for all users.

* **FastAPI**: Powered the backend with a high-performance API framework, ensuring efficient data handling and secure communication between the client and server.

* **ResilientDB**: Implemented as the blockchain framework, providing fault tolerance, scalability, and low-latency transaction management for secure and reliable expense tracking¹.

* **SQLite**: A second database used to store the public keys of all the users, which will be eventually used to update the transaction (money sent and received) from both ends.

* **GIT & GitHub**: Enabled version control and collaboration, ensuring smooth teamwork and reliable code management throughout the development process.

* **JIRA**: Facilitated task tracking and project management, helping the team stay organized, manage sprints, and deliver features efficiently over six sprints of one week each.
