### Experiment 2 - Batching

This experiment aims to test and record the throughput and outgoing bandwidth usage of PBFT and RCC with 64 or 96 replicas with different batch sizes. The batch size is set to 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800.

Experiment results show that increasing batch size benefits PBFT and RCC throughput when batch size increases from 50 to 400. Nonetheless, it makes no difference for PBFT when increasing batch size from 400 to 800, since PBFT is bottlenecked by outgoing bandwidth shown in Figure 6, while the throughput of RCC still increases.

### Experiment 3 - Concurrency

This experiment tests and records the throughput and outgoing bandwidth of RCC with 64 or 96 replicas with different numbers of instances and the batch size is set to 400 and 800.

In RCC, when the number of instances is more than one, increasing instances shows no obvious relevance with throughput. However, as the instance number increases, the outgoing bandwidth decreases. Therefore, as long as we overcome the bandwidth bottleneck, RCC gains higher performance than PBFT combined with the experiment 2 result.
